## Overview
perpustakaanMain is a Java-based library management system that demonstrates core object-oriented programming principles through a clean, modular architecture. Built with Java 17, it showcases inheritance, encapsulation, and extensibility in managing diverse book categories within a library setting.

### Why perpustakaanMain?
This project provides a solid foundation for understanding and building upon library management applications. The core features include:

- üü¢ **Modular Design:** Clear class hierarchy with Buku and BukuFiksi classes for easy extension.
- üîµ **Java 17 Compatibility:** Leverages modern Java features for improved performance and syntax.
- üü° **Object-Oriented Principles:** Demonstrates inheritance and encapsulation effectively.
- üü† **Extensibility:** Easily add new book types or features without disrupting existing code.
- üü£ **Educational Value:** Serves as a practical example for learning structured Java application development.
